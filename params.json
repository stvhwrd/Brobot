Brobot is a prototype for an autonomous nuclear disaster cleanup robot.  The predetermined milestones of development guided the evolution of the robot (physically) and its brain (code).\r\n\r\n![Brobot!](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stvhwrd/brobot/master/Brobot.png)\r\n\r\n### What we used to create and develop ###\r\n\r\n* [VEX Programming Control Starter Kit](http://www.vexrobotics.com/vex/products/robot-starter-kits)\r\n* [ROBOTC for VEX Robotics](http://www.robotc.net/download/vexrobotics/)\r\n* Windows 8.1 (64 bit) via Parallels 10\r\n* Set ROBOTC application preferences as per [ENGR120 pdf](http://bit.ly/1F03s1l)\r\n\r\n### Milestones ###\r\n\r\n* **Milestone 1** - Concept sketches (Individual) due 4 PM on Monday Feb 16, worth 10%\r\n* **Milestone 2** - Mechanical systems test (Group) due Thursday Feb 26 In lab, worth 25%\r\n* **Milestone 3** - Electrical systems test (Group) due Thursday March 12 In lab, worth 25%\r\n* **Milestone 4** - Software systems test and Integrated operation (Group) due March 26 in lab, worth 40%\r\n\r\n### Results ###\r\n\r\nBrobot killed it!
